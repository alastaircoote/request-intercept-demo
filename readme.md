# Request Inteception Demo

A very simple demo of how you might go about using WKURLSchemeHandler to serve
a mix of locally cached assets with remote ones. The coding style is terrible
(exclamation points all over the place, tsk tsk) but hopefully it should convey
the basic concept.

All of the relevant code is in `ViewController.swift`.
